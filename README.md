Study and implementation of Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms for a game of tag. A Bachelor Semester Project by Umut Ucak.

-------------

Scientific Deliverable: The scientific deliverable of this BSP is to study and practice Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms, and understanding the heuristics of the A* pathfinding algorithm in order to find the most fitting one for the game so that the most efficient and quick AI can be put up against the player.

Technical Deliverable: The technical deliverable of this BSP is to study and practice the basics of game design, alongside implementing the dynamic pathfinding algorithm mentioned in the scientific description. The core premise of the gameplay will be a game of cat and mouse inside a dynamic maze, where the player will run away from the AI, while also changing the structure of the maze so that the AI can be confused and avoided. The pathfinding algorithm will let the AI assess the maze in a dynamic fashion in order to find the most efficient path to the player.
